# Kilobot

This Project started in 2021 with interest for robotics.
In 2023 I've known ROS2 (Humble distribution) and started studying.

At the moment is a collection of all information I've got, tips and problem I've found. 

__docs/__ forlder contains an italian (some times mixed) version of this info. 
Later on I'll translate into English, but due to very few doc in italian market I decided to write it in Italian first.

Thanks to the authors that I've found googling the web. They all are linked in documentation. 

ROS2 is not a simple subject to learn. Single concept are simple but translating into practice is hard some times. Lots of details need to be known and offen not all are explaned in a unique and comprehensive source.
